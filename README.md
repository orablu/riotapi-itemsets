# Riot Games API: Item Set Maker
Makes item sets for you based off of a user of your choice!
This is my first time working with the Riot Games API.

## NOTE
You cannot run this without saving your private key to `private_consts.py`! I'm not publishing my key, so it is up to you to supply one. Create the file as follows.

```python
# private_consts.py

API_KEY = '{your key here}'
```
